# Hotspot Rules

 The goal of hotshot is to make as many shots from the marked spots on the court in 1 minute.
 A single round consists of 1 minute of shots plus any earned bonus shots. A game consists of 10 rounds.

 How to Score Hotshot
 There are 8 spots on the court indicated by the colored circles and triangles in the above half court diagram. The number of points you earn from a made shot in each spot is as follows:

 Green = 5 points, Yellow = 4 points, Grey = 3 points, Blue = 2 points, Red = 1 point

 You can only earn 2 total points from baskets made in the red spots per round.
 A round is forfeited and given a 0 score if you forget this rule and make more than 2 layups in a round.
 A heatcheck upgrade is when you score at least 45 points in a round (not including bonus points).
 A GOAT round upgrade indicates you made at least one shot from each spot in a single round.
; Scoring for each round is based on the number of points you accumulate in that round from made shots +
 bonus shots made points

 Rounds 1-9 scoring:
 For a heatcheck round, you get 3 bonus shot attempts, worth triple points.
 Earning a GOAT round earns you 4 bonus shots for that round.

 Final round (10th) scoring:
 In a heatcheck final round, you get two bonus shot attempts for each round you made 30+ points
 (excludes bonus points) over the course of the entire game. These bonus shots are worth double points.

 In a GOAT final round, you get one bonus shot from each of the 8 hotshot spots.

  2 points are deducted for missed red shots. No points deducted for missed bonus red shots.

 Upgrades are not mutually exclusive, meaning GOATs and heatchecks can both be earned in individual rounds. Upgrades are only earned with non-bonus shot makes.

 Winner is determined by the player with the most points.
