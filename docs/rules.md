;; The goal of hotshot is to make as many shots from the marked spots on the court in 1 minute. 
;; A single round consists of 1 minute of shots plus any earned bonus shots. A game consists of 10 rounds.

;; How to Score Hotshot
;; There are 8 spots on the court indicated by the colored circles and triangles in the above half court diagram. The number of points you earn from a made shot in each spot is as follows:

;; Green = 5 points, Yellow = 4 points, Grey = 3 points, Blue = 2 points, Red = 1 point

;; You can only earn 2 total points from baskets made in the red spots per round. 
;; A round is forfeited and given a 0 score if you forget this rule and make more than 2 layups in a round.
;; A heatcheck upgrade is when you score at least 45 points in a round (not including bonus points).
;; A GOAT round upgrade indicates you made at least one shot from each spot in a single round.
; Scoring for each round is based on the number of points you accumulate in that round from made shots + 
;; bonus shots made points

;; Rounds 1-9 scoring:
;; For a heatcheck round, you get 3 bonus shot attempts, worth triple points. 
;; Earning a GOAT round earns you 4 bonus shots for that round.

;; Final round (10th) scoring:
;; In a heatcheck final round, you get two bonus shot attempts for each round you made 30+ points 
;; (excludes bonus points) over the course of the entire game. These bonus shots are worth double points. 

;; In a GOAT final round, you get one bonus shot from each of the 8 hotshot spots.

;;  2 points are deducted for missed red shots. No points deducted for missed bonus red shots.

;; Upgrades are not mutually exclusive, meaning GOATs and heatchecks can both be earned in individual rounds. Upgrades are only earned with non-bonus shot makes.

;; Winner is determined by the player with the most points.
